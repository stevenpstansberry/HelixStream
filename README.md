## Features

### 1. Variant Mutation Analysis üîç

HelixStream tracks the mutations in viral genomes, focusing on specific SARS-CoV-2 variants. The pipeline compares sequences over time, enabling users to observe evolutionary trends, mutation rates, and key genetic differences across variants like Omicron, Delta, and Alpha. 

### 2. Real-Time Sequence Ingestion and Analysis üöÄ

Data is fetched directly from the **NCBI** database via Linux/Unix scripts running on an **AWS EC2** instance. These scripts automate the ingestion of new viral sequences into an **S3 bucket** for scalable storage, providing a seamless flow of data from source to analysis.

### 3. Sequence Alignment and Mutation Metrics Calculation üî¨

Using **Python** and **Biopython**, HelixStream globally aligns sequences through **Clustal Omega** and computes essential metrics such as **Jukes-Cantor Distance** for evolutionary divergence, mutation density per kilobase, and percentage sequence identity. The data is cleaned and preprocessed, making it ready for downstream analyses.

### 4. API Backend with Spring Boot üåê

HelixStream‚Äôs API backend, built with **Spring Boot**, acts as a bridge to execute Linux commands on the EC2 instance, trigger data ingestion, and handle processing requests. This backend service provides a robust API layer that can be used to interact programmatically with the HelixStream pipeline.

### 5. Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard üìä

HelixStream includes a **React** frontend for real-time visualization of key metrics, enabling users to track metrics like Percent Identity, Mutation Density, and Jukes-Cantor Distance over time. With multi-variant comparison capabilities, users can switch between different COVID-19 variants to compare mutation profiles, making it a powerful tool for observing viral evolution.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React**: Provides an interactive user interface for selecting variants, viewing mutation metrics, and comparing different datasets.
- **Next.js**: Seamless integration of backend logic for dynamic bioinformatics data visualization and variant comparison.

### Backend

- **Spring Boot**: Serves as the API layer, managing commands and interactions with the EC2 instance for data ingestion and processing tasks.
- **Linux/Unix Scripting**: Used on the EC2 instance to fetch data from NCBI, upload sequences to S3, and perform other processing tasks.

### Data Processing

- **Python**: Handles data cleaning, sequence alignment, and mutation metric calculation.
- **Biopython**: Provides tools for sequence alignment and analysis, specifically with Clustal Omega, to calculate evolutionary distances.

### Infrastructure

- **AWS S3**: Stores ingested and processed data in a scalable, durable way.
- **AWS EC2**: Runs bash scripts to fetch data, execute processing jobs, and upload results to S3.


## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Account** with IAM privileges for EC2, S3
- **React** installed on your machine.
- **AWS CLI** to configure credentials.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stevenpstansberry/HelixStream.git
cd HelixStream/Frontend
npm install
```

Run the Application
Start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
This will run the app locally at http://localhost:3000 by default.
```

Run Backend Services
Deploy the Spring Boot backend to handle API requests and EC2 scripts for data ingestion and processing.

## Future Improvements

- **Expanded Variant Support**: Add support for tracking additional viral or bacterial pathogens.

- **Automated Data Refresh**: Implement scheduled data ingestion from NCBI, allowing for real-time updates without manual intervention.

- **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling of mutation trends and variant evolution.

- **Public Dashboard Access**: Enhance Grafana settings or use a self-hosted solution for sharing dashboards publicly.

---

**HelixStream** represents a powerful, extensible pipeline for bioinformatics research and analytics, making it adaptable for any project requiring sequence alignment, evolutionary distance metrics, or multi-variant comparison. Its design allows for future expansion, making it a robust tool for tracking viral evolution or applying to other bioinformatics domains.
